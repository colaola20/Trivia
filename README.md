# Project 4 - Trivia

Submitted by: Olha Sorych

**Name of your app** is an app that displays a question and 4 choices. 

Time spent: 6

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view and answer at least 5 trivia questions.
- [x] App retrieves question data from the Open Trivia Database API.
- [x] Fetch a different set of questions if the user indicates they would like to reset the game.
- [x] Users can see score after submitting all questions.
- [x] True or False questions only have two options.

Since I have been moved to an Observer Role, (I'm not sure why because my extension for module 5 hasn't passed by that time) I'm leaving the link for my project for week 6 here: https://github.com/colaola20/Tumblr-Feed.git.
Anyways if it's a miscommunication, I apologize.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

  
- [ ] Allow the user to choose a specific category of questions.
- [ ] Provide the user feedback on whether each question was correct before navigating to the next.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
